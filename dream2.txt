I remember once me and my dad went
really north to the tip of quebec
and I saw the aurora for myself
in my uncles cottage in the middle
of nowhere.  once we went down south
to the grand canyon and saw it in
all its beauty, and for some reason
in my dreams/memories i confuse them
all and i see the northern lights in
the grand canyon.  ive always wanted
that momment to actually happen so i
tried making a game around that idea.
i know it was a pretty short experence
but i hope you enjoyed just walking
around with chill music.
